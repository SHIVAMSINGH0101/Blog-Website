# Blog-Website

This is my personal blog which I made in my initial phase of learning MongoDB and EJS Template. Here anyone can see my posts which consists of a Title and Content.

## Built With
- MongoDB DataBase
- Express : web application framework for Node.js
- EJS : EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. 
- Mongoose : ODM library for MongoDB database and Node.js
- lodash 

Sooner I will developing the frontend with React and also add comment and like posts features.
